**Overall:**  
Great work on this assignment! You made great use of various pandas, and matplotlib functionality. The only direct advice that I have is to keep on practicing and take note of some of the 'tricks' and best practices that you see in class. Make sure you keep on practicing your Python and review those ML fundamentals, especially as we get into the later sections of the course!

**Some notes**  
* Nice use of `np.where()` for those indices!
* In *Question 9*, though it is true that it is not *exactly* normal, we usually would not quite say that it doesn't fit that assumption. What I would normally do is just flag that as a cause for concern or suspicion when it comes to making our model. If, for example, we were to build some form of linear regression to predict GRE score and we saw that there was some error, we could flag the non-normal distribution of the data as a cause for error.
* How would you impute the missing values to retain the data?

I did notice that you did not write out an experimental analysis plan. I would suggest that you go back and think up a proper analysis plan with a model (though you will do this in HW3!).
